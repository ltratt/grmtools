# Quickstart Guide

Most users will probably be interested in the compile-time Yacc feature of
grmtools, which allows traditional `.y` files to be used mostly unchanged in
Rust. This page is a short guide to get you up and running with this feature as
quickly as possible.

grmtools includes both a Yacc-style LR parser ([`lrpar`](lrpar.html)) and a
lex-style lexer ([`lrlex`](lrlex.html)). The lexer breaks input up into individual lexemes and
the parser checks to see if the lexemes conform to a grammar. As the parser
executes, it can either create a generic parse tree, or execute user-specified
Rust code.


## A calculator evaluator

Let's assume we want to create a simple calculator which can evaluate
expressions such as `2 + 3 * 4`. Assuming a fresh Rust project, we first create
a `Cargo.toml` file with the following dependencies:

```toml
[package]
name = "calc"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = ["<authors>"]
edition = "2021"

[[bin]]
doc = false
name = "calc"

[build-dependencies]
cfgrammar = "0.13"
lrlex = "0.13"
lrpar = "0.13"

[dependencies]
cfgrammar = "0.13"
lrlex = "0.13"
lrpar = "0.13"
```

In this situation we want to statically compile the `.y` grammar and `.l` lexer
into Rust code. We thus need to create a
[`build.rs`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html)
file inside the root of our project which can process the lexer and grammar.
`lrlex` provides a simple interface which does both jobs for us in one go.
Our `build.rs` file thus looks as follows:

```rust,noplaypen
use lrlex::CTLexerBuilder;

fn main() {
    CTLexerBuilder::new()
        .lrpar_config(|ctp| {
            ctp.grammar_in_src_dir("calc.y")
                .unwrap()
        })
        .lexer_in_src_dir("calc.l")
        .unwrap()
        .build()
        .unwrap();
}
```

grmtools accepts several different Yacc variants as input. In our case, we want
to execute Rust code as the input is parsed (rather than creating a generic
parse tree which we traverse later), so we specified that the `yacckind` (i.e.
what variant of Yacc file we're using) is `YaccKind::Grmtools`. The grammar file
is stored in `src/calc.y`, but we only specify `calc.y` as the filename to
`lrpar`, since it searches relative to `src/` automatically. Similarly, we only
needed to specify `calc.l` to `lrlex`.


## The lexer

While Yacc-style parsing is powerful, lex-style lexing is less powerful.
grmtools allows you to use whatever lexer you want with `lrpar`. Fortunately, in
this case, `lrlex` is powerful enough for us. `calc.l` looks as follows:
```lex
%%
[0-9]+ "INT"
\+ "+"
\* "*"
\( "("
\) ")"
[\t ]+ ;
```

Roughly speaking, each line after the `%%` line is a regular expression (we use
the [`regex`](https://crates.io/crates/regex) crate), a space character, and a
quoted lexeme type name. For example, if the user gives us input such as `234`
we will create a single lexeme with a value (`234`) and a type (`INT`).

The one exception is the final line: if a lexeme type name is replaced with ‘`;`’
then any matching input is discarded. In this case, whitespace (tabs and spaces)
is lexed, but no lexemes are created from it.


## The grammar

Our initial version of calc.y looks as follows:
```rust,noplaypen
%grmtools{yacckind: Grmtools}
%start Expr
%%
Expr -> Result<u64, ()>:
      Expr '+' Term { Ok($1? + $3?) }
    | Term { $1 }
    ;

Term -> Result<u64, ()>:
      Term '*' Factor { Ok($1? * $3?) }
    | Factor { $1 }
    ;

Factor -> Result<u64, ()>:
      '(' Expr ')' { $2 }
    | 'INT'
      {
          let v = $1.map_err(|_| ())?;
          parse_int($lexer.span_str(v.span()))
      }
    ;
%%
// Any functions here are in scope for all the grammar actions above.

fn parse_int(s: &str) -> Result<u64, ()> {
    match s.parse::<u64>() {
        Ok(val) => Ok(val),
        Err(_) => {
            eprintln!("{} cannot be represented as a u64", s);
            Err(())
        }
    }
}
```

The grammar is in 3 parts, separated by the `%%` lines.

The first part specifies general settings for the grammar, at a minimum the
start rule (`%start Expr`).

The second part is the [Yacc
grammar](https://web.archive.org/web/20220830093827/dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/index.html). It consists of 3
rules (`Expr`, `Term`, and `Factor`) and 6 productions (2 for each rule,
separated by `|` characters). Because we are using the `Grmtools` Yacc variant,
each rule has a Rust type associated with it (after `->`) which specifies the
type that each production’s action must return. A production (sometimes called an “alternative”)
consists of zero or more symbols. Symbols either reference rules or lexemes. If a
production matches text, its ”action” (the Rust code between curly brackets at
the end of the production) is executed.

`lrpar`'s actions are subtly different to Yacc. The `$x` variables refer to
the respective symbol in the production, numbered from 1 (i.e. `$1` refers to the first symbol in
the production). If the symbol references a rule `R` then an instance of
`R`'s type will be stored in the `$x` variable; if the symbol references a lexeme then an `Option<Lexeme>`
instance is returned. A special `$lexer` variable allows access to the lexer.
The most commonly used function that `$lexer` exposes is the `span_str`
function, which allows us to extract `&'input str`s from a `Span` (e.g. to
extract the string represented by a `Lexeme`, we would use
`$lexer.span_str(lexeme.span())`).  As this may suggest, actions may also
reference the special lifetime `'input` (without any `$` prefix), which allows
strings to be returned / stored by the grammar without copying memory.

The third part is arbitrary Rust code which can be called by productions’
actions. In our case we have a simple function which converts integers as
strings into integers as `u64`s: if the user provides an invalid number (e.g.
one that is too big) the system `panic`s.

This example uses a common grmtools idiom: making use of `Result` types. This
allows us to deal with two different issues that prevent evaluation.
First is the “obvious” issue of integers which are too big to represent as
`u64`s: these cause `Err` to be percolated upwards, preventing evaluation.
Second is the issue of error recovery telling us that the user should have
inserted an integer: since it would be confusing for us to insert a default
value in such cases, we `map_err` such cases to `Err`, preventing evaluation.
See the section below [on error recovery](#error-recovery) for more details
about error recovery.


## Putting everything together

The `build.rs` file will statically compile the lexer and grammar into Rust code
that we can then call. The `src/main.rs` file below provides a simple
Python-esque REPL to the user into which they can write calculator expressions:

```rust,noplaypen
use std::io::{self, BufRead, Write};

use lrlex::lrlex_mod;
use lrpar::lrpar_mod;

// Using `lrlex_mod!` brings the lexer for `calc.l` into scope. By default the
// module name will be `calc_l` (i.e. the file name, minus any extensions,
// with a suffix of `_l`).
lrlex_mod!("calc.l");
// Using `lrpar_mod!` brings the parser for `calc.y` into scope. By default the
// module name will be `calc_y` (i.e. the file name, minus any extensions,
// with a suffix of `_y`).
lrpar_mod!("calc.y");

fn main() {
    // Get the `LexerDef` for the `calc` language.
    let lexerdef = calc_l::lexerdef();
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    loop {
        print!(">>> ");
        io::stdout().flush().ok();
        match stdin.lock().lines().next() {
            Some(Ok(ref l)) => {
                if l.trim().is_empty() {
                    continue;
                }
                // Now we create a lexer with the `lexer` method with which
                // we can lex an input.
                let lexer = lexerdef.lexer(l);
                // Pass the lexer to the parser and lex and parse the input.
                let (res, errs) = calc_y::parse(&lexer);
                for e in errs {
                    println!("{}", e.pp(&lexer, &calc_y::token_epp));
                }
                match res {
                    Some(Ok(r)) => println!("Result: {:?}", r),
                    _ => eprintln!("Unable to evaluate expression.")
                }
            }
            _ => break
        }
    }
}
```

We can now `cargo run` our project and evaluate simple expressions:

```
>>> 2 + 3
Result: 5
>>> 2 + 3 * 4
Result: 14
>>> (2 + 3) * 4
Result: 20
```


# Error recovery

Because powerful error recovery is built into `lrpar`, we can even make minor
errors and have the system recover automatically:

```
>>> 2 + + 3
Parsing error at line 1 column 5. Repair sequences found:
   1: Delete +
   2: Insert INT
Result: 5
>>> 2 + 3 3
Parsing error at line 1 column 7. Repair sequences found:
   1: Delete 3
   2: Insert +
   3: Insert *
Result: 5
>>> 2 + 3 4 5
Parsing error at line 1 column 7. Repair sequences found:
   1: Insert *, Delete 4
   2: Insert +, Delete 4
   3: Delete 4, Delete 5
   4: Insert *, Shift 4, Delete 5
   5: Insert *, Shift 4, Insert +
   6: Insert *, Shift 4, Insert *
   7: Insert +, Shift 4, Delete 5
   8: Insert +, Shift 4, Insert +
   9: Insert +, Shift 4, Insert *
Result: 17
```

Note that we didn't have to do anything clever in order for error recovery to
happen: it happens by default, and it works with whatever grammar we throw at
it. The way to read the resulting error messages are that each numbered repair
sequence is a way that the error recovery system found to make sense of the
input. For example, for the input `2 + + 3`, an error is detected at the second
`+`: we could either delete the second `+` (option 1 above) or insert an
integer. In all cases, error recovery applies repair sequence 1, and continues
parsing. `2 + + 3` was thus parsed as if the user had written `2 + 3`,
hence why it evaluated to 5. Similarly, `2 + 3 4 5` was parsed as if the user
had written `2 + 3 * 5`.

Error recovery opens up a number of possibilities to customise and streamline
the user experience. For example, the simple approach above causes a `panic` if
the user provides a non-u64 number *or* if error recovery inserts an integer.
For more details about the possibilities, [see the section on error
recovery](errorrecovery.html).
